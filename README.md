# Mistral on Heroku

This is an experimental repo, the goal is to run Mistral on Heroku. At the
moment it is only partially complete and wont fully work. Any help making it
work would be appreciated.

This is mostly done out of interest as a way for people to try Mistral more
easily.

This should never be used for a production Mistral.
